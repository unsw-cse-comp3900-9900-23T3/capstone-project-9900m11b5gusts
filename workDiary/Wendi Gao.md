Week 2. 2023/09/24

We formed a group, called 5Gusts. Strange. We have 5 members in the group, including me. I will take charge of front-end programming.

Our project is P20, which aims to develop A 'Gumtree' like web or app. I read through the requirement description file. I wrote down the functions expected.

I will start with what I can do. I will realize the sign-up and sign-in functionality first.




Week 3 2023/10/01

We finished writing the proposal. I drew half of the user interface diagram and modified the 'novelty' part. 

We have set up both the basic backend and frontend. Users can register new accounts now. I made the frontend interface.

We have discussed the upcoming missions. For frontend, I will be responsible for the user part, while the others will be responsible for the campaign manager and system administrator part.
