Week2: 09/24
I and four other classmates have formed a group called '5Gusts.' We chose project P20 (Woolworths/Colles Collectables Exchange Management System). After a group discussion, we clarified our roles. I am responsible for writing the front-end code.



Week3: 10/01
We finished writing the proposal. I compared the operational modes of existing relevant software, evaluated their pros and cons, and wrote the 'novelty' part.
Our team has set up both the basic backend and the frontend. Users can register new accounts now.
We've deliberated on the upcoming missions. Regarding the front end, I'll be in charge of the system administrator interface.
