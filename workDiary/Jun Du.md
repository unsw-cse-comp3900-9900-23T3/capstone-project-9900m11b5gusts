Week 2. 2023/09/24
I, along with four other classmates, have formed a group called '5Gusts.' We have chosen the project P20 (Woolworths/Colles Collectables Exchange Management Systemï¼‰. After a group discussion, we have clarified our roles. I am responsible for writing the front-end code. 
Week3 2023/10/01
We finished writing the proposal. I compared the operational modes of existing relevant software, evaluated their pros and cons, and modified the 'novelty' part.
We have set up both the basic backend and the frontend. Users can register new accounts now.
We've deliberated on the upcoming missions. Regarding the frontend, I'll be in charge of the system administrator interface, whereas the others will handle the campaign manager and user interface components.
